Data analysis has the capability to enrich the lives of many, yet it presents a fundamental threat to individual privacy. Formal privacy constraints such as differential privacy serve to protect individual rights while allowing large-scale data analytics to proceed relatively unhindered. However, such constraints are a significant barrier to the access of relevant data. In this abstract, we give a solution that leverages type-directed synthesis and the privacy-aware type system DFuzz to allow users to automatically and efficiently synthesize programs that respect privacy constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a technique for proving randomized privacy mechanisms are sufficiently accurate via reduction to synthesis.
