I'm a post-doc working in the Trishul lab. My research currently focuses on the intersection of probabilistic logic programming and deep learning, although my broader interests include social issues arising from the widespread adoption of ML, provable privacy and fairness, and algorithmic improvements in program synthesis.

I completed my PhD at UW Madison, where I was advised by Aws Albarghouthi.

My thesis and CV are available on request.
